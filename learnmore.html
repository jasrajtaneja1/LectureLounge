      <p>Welcome to Lecture Lounge, the web app that makes collaborating with your classmates at UVic easier than ever before. Our app allows you to chat with your classmates in online chat rooms specific to each of your classes. Additionally, you can create your own profile and exchange personal information with your peers. Here's how it works:</p>
      <h3>Chat Rooms for Each of Your Classes</h3>
      <p>When you log in to Lecture Lounge, you'll see a list of all your courses. Simply click on the course you want to chat about, and you'll be taken to a dedicated chat room for that course. Here, you can ask your classmates questions, discuss assignments and projects, and even share study tips.</p>
      
      <h3>Make Your Own Profile</h3>
      <p>To make it easy to connect with your classmates, we've included the ability to create your own profile. You can add a profile picture, a short bio, and even a list of your interests. This makes it easier for your classmates to get to know you and connect with you outside of class.</p>
      
      <h3>Exchange Personal Information</h3>
      <p>In addition to chatting about class-related topics, you may want to connect with your classmates on a personal level. With Lecture Lounge, you can exchange personal information like phone numbers or social media handles in a safe and secure environment. Simply click on a user's profile to see if they've added any contact information.</p>
      
      <h2>The Founders</h2>
      <p>Lecture Lounge was founded by three UVic students who recognized the need for better online communication tools within their classes. Frustrated with the lack of options available, they decided to tackle the challenge themselves.</p>
      <p>Their goal was to create an easy-to-use, accessible platform that would help students connect with their classmates and improve their overall learning experience. With their combined skills in programming, design, and business, they were able to create Lecture Lounge - a platform that has already helped thousands of students at UVic.</p>
      
      <p>Thank you for considering Lecture Lounge as a tool to help you collaborate with your classmates. We hope you find our platform useful and look forward to hearing your feedback!</p>
